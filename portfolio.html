<p class=fresh>"The Raise the Wage Act would finally set us on a path to ensuring that all working people earn a living wage. The Raise the Wage Act would gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. After 2025, automatically increase the minimum wage each year at the same rate that median wages increase.".</p>
